tested
vector based worthiness (no significant speed change)
promotion quiesce (done)
quiescence tt cut (huge)
quiescence tt ordering (bust)
switch to 6 bitboard pieces format (worse, not fully optimized)
more aggressive lmr on losing captures (might be slightly better to nothing)
moving up losing capture priority past history (like neutral)
basic losing captures reduction (kinda bad)
quiescence check fiddling (don't stand-pat during checks) (neutralish to bad, fail)

todo
bail aspiration
razoring
tt replacement fiddling
switch to 14 bitboard pieces format
see pruning (pzchessbot inspo)
quiescence checkmate detection
