tested
vector based worthiness (no significant speed change)
promotion quiesce (done)
quiescence tt cut (huge)
quiescence tt ordering (bust)
switch to 6 bitboard pieces format (worse, not fully optimized)
more aggressive lmr on losing captures (might be slightly better to nothing)
moving up losing capture priority past history (like neutral)
basic losing captures reduction (kinda bad)
quiescence check fiddling (don't stand-pat during checks) (neutralish to bad, fail)
remove losing capture restriction in quiescence (fail, like -8 elo)
delta pruning (margin 200, disallow negative see) (+26elo)
pre-movegen quiescence pruning (negative, fail)
don't use 0 as default in aspiration search (like neutral, fail)
aspiration window change based on node type (solid flop, ~-11)
razoring (+24elo)
mobility tuning (still room for improvement probably, i think can incorporate into texel) (+25elo)
change killer move replacement strategy from always-replace (small increase? but cba count it)
change number of killers stored (nada)
null move depth restriction (lower elo)
use old killers from two plies ago (neutralish - negative?)
reduce max history to 500 (pretty big fail)
see promotion (negativeish, fail)
lmr log formula (like 14 elo)
bishop pair bonus (like neutral, need to retry with tuning)
pst tuning (big wins, 40 elo (on non tuned opening book) to 70 (on tuned opening book))

todo
bail aspiration
tt replacement fiddling
switch to 14 bitboard pieces format
see pruning (pzchessbot inspo)
quiescence checkmate detection
quadratic futility
stronger eval
insert tt on prunes
retry improving heuristic
multicut
make eval take a board instead of a game
kill worthiness for pieces because of desync with psts
make tuner support epd based pgns
check pesto without broken psts
